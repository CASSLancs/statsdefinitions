  "description": "Variables can vary, or take on different values, across a dataset. For example, gender could vary between speakers in a corpus. Lots of corpora research is about identifying these variables and finding relationships between them. There is a distinction between linguistic variables - frequencies of linguistic features - and explanatory variables - contexts in which the features appear. They can be nominal, ordinal, and scale variables."
