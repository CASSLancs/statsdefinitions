  "disambiguatingDescription": "Quantitative variable, with values anywhere on a scale.",
  "description": "Variable whose value can be anywhere on a scale, showing the quantity of a particular feature. As the value is a measurable quantity (as opposed to rank orders), arithmetic operations such as add, subtract, multiple and divide can be applied. For linguistic variables, the scale can be relative frequencies of a linguistic feature in different texts or subcorpora. The frequency distribution of these can be shown in histograms."
