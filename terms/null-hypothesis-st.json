  "description": "NHST is a method of testing a hypothesis using a statistical test. The method is as follows:\n1. Formulate the alternative hypothesis, or H₁ (for example, students and professors differ in their use of swear words)\n2. Formulate the null hypothesis, or H₀ - this is the opposite of H₁, and represents a hypothesis stating there's no difference in the two corpora, i.e. no interesting changes are happening.\n3. Test the null hypothesis with a statistical test for which the data satisfies the assumptions.\n4. Check the p-value compared to your cutoff (conventionally 0.05 or 5%, but a lower cutoff can be used if you want a lower risk). If it is less, then you can reject the null hypothesis as being unlikely to be due to chance, and the result is statistically significant. If the p-value is more than or equal to the cutoff that doesn't mean either H₀ is true or H₁ is false - it just means this data does not have enough evidence to reject H₀ (and a larger dataset could have enough evidence to be statistically significant)."
