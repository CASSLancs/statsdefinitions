  "description": "A series of corpus-based findings that can be used for statistical analysis. It is a systematic collection of individual results - often a spreadsheet with data points in the rows and variables in the columns. You can study these for a \"shape\" that helps you identify statistical analyses that lend themselves to the particular data."
