  "disambiguatingDescription": "Variable with groups, and no order.",
  "description": "Variable whose value represent different categories in which the data can be grouped, without an order or hierarchy. For example, gender can be assigned one of a few groups, and there is no hierarchy within the groups. The groups are often assigned short-hand numbers just for convenience (e.g. 0 for male, 1 for female), but they confer no particular value (the numbers could be swapped, or changed entirely)."
