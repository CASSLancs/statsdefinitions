  "description": "A statistical test is a procedure in a branch of inferential stats, whose underlying logic relies on Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST). It produces a P-value and usually a test statistic. The P-value can be used to reject the null hypothesis, if the p value is lower than the cut-off point (for more information, see NHST)"
