  "disambiguatingDescription": "Spread of values in a dataset.",
  "description": "Dispersion is how values in a scale variable's dataset are spread. This can be represented visually by drawing a line, on which values are plotted - you can then see how far apart the values are, as well as range and interquartile range. Alternatively standard deviation can be used to describe distances from the mean."
