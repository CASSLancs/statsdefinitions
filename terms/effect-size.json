  "description": "Effect size is a standardised and comparable measure within descriptive statistics that expresses the practical importance of an effect observed in corpora. For example if a statistical test determines that two groups of speakers (e.g. students and professors) differ in the use of a linguistic variable, effect size such as r, odds ratio, or cohen's d can be used to understand the impact of that effect. Cohen (1988) provides some standard interpretations, but they are not necessarily absolute truth. An effect size (r) of 0.1 is a small effect, 0.3 is a medium effect, and 0.5 is a large effect."
